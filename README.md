Enhanced the usability of a web page that has too much information. To make it easier to find information and read the page, progressive enhancement is used to add pagination and search filter.

The page includes a list of 54 students. 10 students display per page, where the user uses buttons to jump between the lists of 10 students.

In addition, the search field is dynamically genereated so that users can search through the list of students.
